# Digital Sustainability Package
Cygni Tech Summit 2023 (CTS 2023) focused on Digital Sustainability. Digital Sustainability, or Green Software, is important to Cygni for several reasons.


* Environmental Impact Reduction: By focusing on green software, Cygni can significantly reduce the environmental impact of its digital solutions. This includes minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions, which is increasingly important in the face of global climate challenges.

* Market Responsiveness: There is a growing demand for environmentally sustainable products and services. By adopting green software practices, Cygni positions itself favorably in a market that values sustainability, attracting clients who prioritize environmental responsibility.

* Cost Efficiency: Green software often leads to more efficient use of resources, which can translate into cost savings. This includes reduced energy bills and potentially lower hardware costs due to optimized software that demands less from the infrastructure.

* Regulatory Compliance: As governments and international bodies impose stricter regulations on carbon emissions and environmental sustainability, adopting green software practices ensures that Cygni stays compliant with these evolving standards.

* Corporate Responsibility and Reputation: Demonstrating a commitment to sustainability through green software aligns with corporate social responsibility goals. It enhances Cygni's reputation as a forward-thinking, responsible company.

* Innovation and Competitive Advantage: Green software development often requires innovative approaches. This not only leads to more sustainable solutions but can also give Cygni a competitive edge in terms of technology and thought leadership in the industry.

* Employee Engagement and Talent Attraction: Many professionals are keen to work for companies that are committed to sustainability. By adopting green software practices, Cygni can attract and retain talent who are motivated by environmental concerns.

In line with these benefits, Cygni can leverage resources such as the Green Software Foundation, SDI Alliance, and the Linux Foundation to deepen its understanding and implementation of green software practices. Additionally, Cygni's Digital Sustainability Package, including workshops on green software, is a valuable tool for spreading awareness and skills among its teams and clients. The Linux Foundation's certificate on Green Software is also a valuable resource for developers to formalize their knowledge in this area.

CTS 2023 offers Cygni's consultants a Digital Sustainability Package. It consists of several smaller parts:

* The green software wiki, this wiki will gather good links together with ways of working both for you as a Green Software Practitioner and how you can bring this knowledge to your team.
* A slackbot called @CarbonJovi that the consultants can use ChatGPT-style to ask questions about Green Software. @CarbonJovi is created by Tommy Wassgren and uses embeddings and OpenAI ChatGPT 4 to answer Green Software-related questions.
* Three packages that Cygni's consultants can bring to their clients – the packages are simply called Small, Medium, Large. The small package is created to simply increase awareness of Green Software to the clients, it takes about an hour to complete. The medium package increases awareness but also focuses on some practical patterns/goals/measurements that can be appropriate for the team – it takes about 4 hours to complete. The large package includes all of the above and also helps with studying for the Linux Foundation Certificate on becoming a Green Software Practitioner (https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/) – the certificate that comes with a badge is called LFC131.
