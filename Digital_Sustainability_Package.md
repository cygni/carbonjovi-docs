# Digital Sustainability Package
Cygni Tech Summit 2023 focused on Digital Sustainability. Digital Sustainability, or Green Software, is important to Cygni for several reasons.


* Environmental Impact Reduction: By focusing on green software, Cygni can significantly reduce the environmental impact of its digital solutions. This includes minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions, which is increasingly important in the face of global climate challenges.

* Market Responsiveness: There is a growing demand for environmentally sustainable products and services. By adopting green software practices, Cygni positions itself favorably in a market that values sustainability, attracting clients who prioritize environmental responsibility.

* Cost Efficiency: Green software often leads to more efficient use of resources, which can translate into cost savings. This includes reduced energy bills and potentially lower hardware costs due to optimized software that demands less from the infrastructure.

* Regulatory Compliance: As governments and international bodies impose stricter regulations on carbon emissions and environmental sustainability, adopting green software practices ensures that Cygni stays compliant with these evolving standards.

* Corporate Responsibility and Reputation: Demonstrating a commitment to sustainability through green software aligns with corporate social responsibility goals. It enhances Cygni's reputation as a forward-thinking, responsible company.

* Innovation and Competitive Advantage: Green software development often requires innovative approaches. This not only leads to more sustainable solutions but can also give Cygni a competitive edge in terms of technology and thought leadership in the industry.

* Employee Engagement and Talent Attraction: Many professionals are keen to work for companies that are committed to sustainability. By adopting green software practices, Cygni can attract and retain talent who are motivated by environmental concerns.

In line with these benefits, Cygni can leverage resources such as the Green Software Foundation, SDI Alliance, and the Linux Foundation to deepen its understanding and implementation of green software practices. Additionally, Cygni's Digital Sustainability Package, including workshops on green software, is a valuable tool for spreading awareness and skills among its teams and clients. The Linux Foundation's certificate on Green Software is also a valuable resource for developers to formalize their knowledge in this area.
